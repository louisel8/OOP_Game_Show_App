This is a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter."

V1

This is a browser-based word guessing game called "Phrase Hunter." I have used JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to select a random hidden phrase that a player tries to guess by clicking letters on keyboard or using mouse. This is a very challenging project. 

After completing this project, I have gained a better understanding of the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. 

The user has 5 attempts. Each time the user guesses a letter, if it is not in the phrase, the letter is marked as wrong, and the user loses one attempt. If the user guesses all the letters correctly before making 5 incorrect guesses, the user wins. Otherwise, the user loses. The user is able to play again, and the project is designed to reset after each round. 

I have made a little bit style changes, e.g. by hover effect to the button and to the letters, so it would be more user friendly and easy to play visually.

Keep learning and keep pushing forward.
